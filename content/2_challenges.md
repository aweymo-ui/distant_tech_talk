The time-intensive nature of transcription has made many oral history collections an undervalued format in digital initiatives. Meeting accessibility standards involves not only transcribing recordings but also presenting them in an intuitive, navigable digital interface. OHD developer Devin Becker’s solution displays the audio at the top of the page, followed by a visualization of the entire recording displaying the colored tags, a key to the tags, a search bar for keyword queries and the transcription below. This allows researchers to follow along with the timestamped transcript as the audio plays. 

Despite advancements in the oral history player interface, the primary hurdle in developing these collections has been the initial transcription process. Since OHD’s development in 2016, machine learning speech detection abilities have improved considerably. However, earlier free options were either so poor that they were negligible to working from scratch, or they were prohibitively expensive for a higher education institution. Completely human driven transcription has its own challenges: it’s tedious, slow moving work that isn’t going to be the highlight of a student worker’s CV, and, without close supervision, can result in lapses in quality akin to poor machine learning. 

Similar lapses in identification and vulnerability to bias were a challenge when student workers created tags for transcriptions. Tags—ranging from locations, people, or even abstract emotions—were created by student workers as they identified them throughout the transcription process. This approach led to multiple challenges: an uncontrolled vocabulary, tags that are not apparent if transcribing a recording linearly and tags pertinent only to a single recording rather than the entire collection. Additional challenges included formatting documents to the UTH-8 sheets that OHD requires and knowledge gaps amongst student workers, who may lack the historical, scientific or regional knowledge to identify the tags within dialogue.
